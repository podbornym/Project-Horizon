@yes5
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> What's the process to make the prints?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> The paper would be glued to the blocks and rubbed with oil, peeling away upper layers to create a thin, translucent layer.
This layer acted as a guide for the block cutter, carving away non-black areas to form raised, inked areas.
This destroyed the original drawing in the process.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> But they used the blocks to create the final piece, right?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Correct! The artist would place the paper on the inked blocks and rubbed with a burnishing tool, creating the print you see today.
This print is hand-colored, something not commonly seen during the Ukiyo-e period.

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, there were many steps to creating these prints
The artist first draws the design with ink on handmade paper, and then... hmm...
Well, I don't quite remember, to be honest.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> (Maybe I can find something to jog his memory.)
