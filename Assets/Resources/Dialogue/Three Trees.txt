<b>Ren:</b> Tell me about <i>The Three Trees.</i>
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Veritas:</b> This etching was created in 1643.
The scene shows a cloudy hillside and three trees, as the name might suggest.
It also shows an artist on the top of the hill, and some people fishing.
This would be an interesting piece to forge for yourself, give it a try? #next

<b>Ren:</b> Do you know about Rembrandt?
#SetBaroqueMuse
<b>Veritas:</b> He was considered one of the greatest painters and printmakers in European Art and the most important in Dutch history.
Although his art was popular, he experienced much personal tragedy and financial hardship.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> That's so sad!
#SetBaroqueMuse
<b>Veritas:</b> Well, at least you are making good money for recreating his works.
Im sure he would be happy someone is getting paid! #next

@yes5
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Can you tell me anything else about engraving and etching?
#SetBaroqueMuse
<b>Veritas:</b> The artist uses blocks of metal usually, and uses tools to create an image in the metal.
The spaces created in the metal then hold ink in, and when pressed onto paper transfer the held ink to the paper.

<b>Ren:</b> What do the artists use for these prints?
#SetBaroqueMuse
<b>Veritas:</b> Typically, the artist will use tools and put an image in a chunk of material.
This image is then transferred to a sheet of paper somehow.
That's all I can remember for now...
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> I'll come back later then.
