Welcome to Con Artiste!
A game about art history, taught through the use of art forgery and intuitive minigames. 
Your uncle left you this mansion, complete with a secret underground lab.
You navigate with the Mouse, using the Left Mouse Button on objects that make the mouse Cursor change directions and color.
Once you have found the lab, your goal is to complete art forgeries, just like your uncle.
You can teleport to 3 zones: The Ukiyo-e, Surrealism, and Baroque art periods are all open for exploration.
Once in a zone, find a studio to work from. In each studio is a Muse...click on them to start a conversation.
Talk a bit, and a clue in the studio will activate - you just have to find it!
Once found, you can play a minigame. Once you complete the minigame, you have progressed 1/6 of the way to finishing a forery.
When you have played all the games, return to Woodstock, your friendly mannequin Woodstock will offer to sell your painting on the Black Market.
Succeed, and you will be rewarded generously.
Otherwise, the cops might catch on to your historically accurate replicas.
Enjoy!
