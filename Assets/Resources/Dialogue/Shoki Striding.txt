<b>Ren:</b> Tell me about <i>Shoki Striding.</i>
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, the print was created between 1740 to 1741.
It is very unique in that it is much, much taller than it is wider.
I think you might enjoy trying to recreate it. Interested?

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Ah yes, <i>Shoki Striding (Shoki Zu).</i>
It is a very intersting print, to be sure.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> What's wrong?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> I'm having difficulty remembering the details.
<b>Ren:</b> (I should try to show it to him.)

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> In this print we see a Japanese man, facing left.
It is believed that the print depicts a great general "striding" through the frame.
Would you like to try and frame something similar?

<b>Ren:</b> Do you know anything about Okumura?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Okumura Masanobu is believed to have been self-taught in the Ukiyo-e method of woodblock printing.
He was influenced by the Torii school of ukiyo-e printing.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> What is "Torri"?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Torii is a specific school of ukio-e painting and printing.
It is known for developing ukiyo-e as an art-form, often depicted actors and kabuki scenes. 
Why not try printing like they did?

He used thick black lines in many of his prints.
#SetPlayer

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Hmm, I'm having a hard time remembering...
#SetPlayer

#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Any more details about this print?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> The animal-based glue nikawa made the paint look more "lacquer."
It was often used to enhance a particular element of the print.
In <i>Shoki Striding</i> we can see that the hair of the figure is quite defined.
Additionally, mica, mital dust, and other elements were used by the artists of the period.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Intersting. What did those do?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Those materials were mainly used to add deeper contrast enhance the appearances of specific elements.
You should try to enhance your abilities.

#SetPlayer

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Nope. At least for now...

#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Know anything else about the wood blocks?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> The wooden blocks were brought to a <i>horoshi,</i> or woodcarver.
They would carve away relief lines of the image for inking.
Then a <i>surushi</i> (printer) would produce the print with the woodblocks.
Do you want to try for yourself?

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> It starts off with a series of woodblocks.
Typically the type of wood used was cherrywood.
There was more to this, but I can't recall what.
#SetPlayer

<b>Ren:</b> What else can you tell me about the period?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> As the period came to an end, there was a large diversity in genre for Ukiyo-e paintings.
But it declined as the century ended, being seen as both old-fashioned and requiring too much effort.
Perhaps you'd like to test your knowledge?

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, the Ukiyo-e art pieces depicted the entertainments of Edo in the beginning.
This included amusements such as coutesan and kabuki actors.
I know of more, but it's a bit foggy right now. Come back later.
