<b>Ren:</b> Tell me about <i>The Board Partition with Letter Rack and Music Book.</i>
#SetBaroqueMuse
<b>Veritas:</b> Well, the painting was created in 1668.
It depicts what a pin board of that time may have looked like.
I think you might enjoy trying to recreate it. Interested? #next

<b>Ren:</b> Any more details about this painting?

@yes5
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Why would he have painted a pin board?
#SetBaroqueMuse
<b>Veritas:</b> Pin boards contain letters, which create an identity.
A painting of a pin board could be seen as an alternative to a portrait.
