#SetUkiyoMuse

The man on this print appears very angry indeed.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> (Doesn't look like he wants to talk. I should show him something to spark his interest.)

#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> So, what else can you tell me about this mystery artist?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, historians have analyzed many prints from the time.
It appears as though this specific artist was active from 1774 to 1795.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> That's quite a long time.
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Yes it was.
The artist here was called by their pen-name, "Toshusai Sharaku."
There have been 140 prints established as Shakaru's making.
Would you like to try and create something like this mysterious man? #next

<b>Ren:</b> Any more details about this print?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> This prints details a yakko, manservant used by samurai.
However, this was no ordinary manservant. 
This yakko here was used by samurai to perform many violent, cruel deeds
The artist here portrays the menacing character with outstrecthed hands and a leering, devil-like face.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Wow, doesn't sound like a good dude.
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> While the yakko was not, the actor protraying him was.
In fact, that is why actors often made it on ukiyo-e prints, publicism.
You should try to recreate the sterness of the features seen here. #next

#SetPlayer

#SetUkiyoMuse

#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Know anything else about the wood blocks?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> The wooden blocks were brought to a <i>horoshi,</i> or woodcarver.
They would carve away relief lines of the image for inking.
Then a <i>surushi</i> (printer) would produce the print with the woodblocks.

#SetUkiyoMuse

Typically the type of wood used was cherrywood.
There was more to this, but I can't recall what.

#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> What else can you tell me about the period?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> As the period came to an end, there was a large diversity in genre for Ukiyo-e paintings.
But it declined as the century ended, being seen as both old-fashioned and requiring too much effort.

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, the Ukiyo-e art pieces depicted the entertainments of Edo in the beginning.
This included amusements such as coutesan and kabuki actors.
I know of more, but it's a bit foggy right now. Come back later.
