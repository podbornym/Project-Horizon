Ren: Tell me about <i>The Great Wave off Kanagawa.</i>
Nasu: Well, the painting was created between 1830 and 1833.
It depicts a large wave terrorizing boats off the coast of Kanagawa.
I think you might enjoy trying to recreate it. Interested?

Ren: Can you tell me about this painting?
Nasu: Ah yes, <i>The Great Wave off Kanagawa.</i>
It's quite a beautiful painting, yet...
Ren: What's wrong?
Nasu: I'm having difficulty remembering the details.
Ren: (I should try to show it to him.)

Ren: Remember anything else about the wave?
Nasu: The wave is both the center of the piece and a frame for another part.
If you look closely, you can see that Mount Fuji is framed by the wave.
Would you like to try and frame something in a painting?

Ren: What's with the wave?
Nasu: Well, while the wave is quite large, it's most likely not a tsunami.
Rather it is about the size of a large rogue wave, based on the size of those boats.
Ren: Anything else?
Nasu: Maybe later. It should come back to me any minute now...

Ren: Do you know anything about Hokusai?
Nasu: Hokusai first became known after creating a print of the Buddhist Daruma.
From then on he has made many prints, but most were destroyed in a studio fire.
Ren: That's so tragic!
Nasu: Well, at least you won't have to worry about your studio lighting on fire.
Why not try painting something?

Ren: Who is the creator of this?
Nasu: Hokusai, the apprentice of Kastukawa Shunsho.
Katsukawa was one of the foremost Ukiyo-e artists of the time.
Ren: But what about Hokusai?
Nasu: Hmm, I'm having a hard time remembering...
Ren: (I'll ask him later. I'm sure he knows something.)

Ren: Any more details about this painting?
Nasu: The wave and Mount Fuji actually form a sense of unity.
They create Yin and Yang, forming balance in the system.
You should try to balance out your artistic abilities.

Ren: Do you know any small details about this painting?
Nasu: The boats in the picture can act as a scale to determine how big the wave is.
It's actually not all that huge.
Ren: Anything else?
Nasu: If you look to the upper corner, you can see the artist's signature.
Ren: Maybe I'll come back later...

@yes5
Ren: Know anything else about the wood blocks?
Nasu: The wooden blocks were brought to a <i>horoshi,</i> or woodcarver.
They would carve away relief lines of the image for inking.
Then a <i>surushi</i> (printer) would produce the print with the woodblocks.
Do you want to try for yourself?

Ren: What do the artists use for these paintings?
Nasu: It starts off with a series of woodblocks.
Typically the type of wood used was cherrywood.
There was more to this, but I can't recall what.
Ren: I'll come back later then.

@yes6
Ren: What else can you tell me about the period?
Nasu: As the period came to an end, there was a large diversity in genre for Ukiyo-e paintings.
But it declined as the century ended, being seen as both old-fashioned and requiring too much effort.
Perhaps you'd like to test your knowledge?

@no6
Ren: What can you tell me about this time period?
Nasu: Well, the Ukiyo-e art pieces depicted the entertainments of Edo in the beginning.
This included things like coutesan and kabuki actors.
I know of more, but it's a bit foggy right now. Come back later.
