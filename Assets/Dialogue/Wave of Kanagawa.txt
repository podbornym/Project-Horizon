<b>Ren:</b> Tell me about <i>The Great Wave off Kanagawa.</i>
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, the painting was created between 1830 and 1833.
It depicts a large wave terrorizing boats off the coast of Kanagawa.
I think you might enjoy trying to recreate it. Interested?

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Ah yes, <i>The Great Wave off Kanagawa.</i>
It's quite a beautiful painting, yet...
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> What's wrong?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> I'm having difficulty remembering the details.
<b>Ren:</b> (I should try to show it to him.)

<b>Ren:</b> Remember anything else about the wave?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> The wave is both the center of the piece and a frame for another part.
If you look closely, you can see that Mount Fuji is framed by the wave.
Would you like to try and frame something in a painting?

<b>Ren:</b> What's with the wave?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, while the wave is quite large, it's most likely not a tsunami.
Rather it is about the size of a large rogue wave, based on the size of the boats.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Anything else?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Maybe later. It should come back to me any minute now...

<b>Ren:</b> Do you know anything about Hokusai?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Hokusai first became known after creating a print of the Buddhist Daruma.
From then on he has made many prints, but most were destroyed in a studio fire.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> That's so tragic!
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, at least you won't have to worry about your studio lighting on fire.
Why not try painting something?

<b>Ren:</b> Who is the creator of this?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Hokusai, the apprentice of Kastukawa Shunsho.
Katsukawa was one of the foremost Ukiyo-e artists of the time.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> But what about Hokusai?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Hmm, I'm having a hard time remembering...
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> (I'll ask him later. I'm sure he knows something.)

<b>Ren:</b> Any more details about this painting?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> The wave and Mount Fuji actually form a sense of unity.
They create Yin and Yang, forming balance in the system.
You should try to balance out your artistic abilities.

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> The boats in the picture can act as a scale to determine how big the wave is.
The wave isn't as large as it appears.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Anything else?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> If you look to the upper corner, you can see the artist's signature.

#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Know anything else about the wood blocks?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> The wooden blocks were brought to a <i>horoshi,</i> or woodcarver.
They would carve away relief lines of the image for inking.
Then a <i>surushi</i> (printer) would produce the print with the woodblocks.
Do you want to try for yourself?

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> It starts off with a series of woodblocks.
Typically the type of wood used was cherrywood.
There was more to this, but I can't recall what.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> I'll come back later then.

<b>Ren:</b> What else can you tell me about the period?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> As the period came to an end, there was a large diversity in genre for Ukiyo-e paintings.
But it declined as the century ended, being seen as both old-fashioned and requiring too much effort.
Perhaps you'd like to test your knowledge?

#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, the Ukiyo-e art pieces depicted the entertainments of Edo in the beginning.
This included amusements such as coutesan and kabuki actors.
I know of more, but it's a bit foggy right now. Come back later.
