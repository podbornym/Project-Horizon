Ren: Tell me about <i>The Great Wave off Kanagawa.</i>
Nasu: Well, the painting was created between 1830 and 1833.
It depicts a large wave terrorizing boats off the coast of Kanagawa.
I think you might enjoy trying to recreate it. Interested?

Ren: Can you tell me about this painting?
Nasu: Ah yes, <i>The Great Wave off Kanagawa.</i>
It's quite a beautiful painting, yet...
Ren: What's wrong?
Nasu: I'm having difficulty remembering the details.
Ren: (I should try to show it to him.)

Ren: Remember anything else about the wave?
Nasu: The wave is both the center of the piece and a frame for another part.
If you look closely, you can see that Mount Fuji is framed by the wave.
Would you like to try and frame something in a painting?

Ren: What's with the wave?
Nasu: Well, while the wave is quite large, it's most likely not a tsunami.
Rather it is about the size of a large rogue wave, based on those boats.
Ren: Anything else?
Nasu: Maybe later. It should come back to me any minute now...

Ren: Do you know anything about Hokusai?
Nasu: Hokusai first became known after creating a print of the Buddhist Daruma.
From then on he has made many prints, but most were destroyed in a studio fire.
Ren: That's so tragic!
Nasu: Well, at least you won't have to worry about your studio lighting on fire.
Why not try painting something?

Ren: Who is the creator of this?
Nasu: Hokusai, the apprentice of Kastukawa Shunsho.
Katsukawa was one of the foremost Ukiyo-e artists of the time.
Ren: But what about Hokusai?
Nasu: Hmm, I'm having a hard time remembering...
Ren: (I'll ask him later. I'm sure he knows something.)

Ren: Any more details about this painting?
Nasu: The wave and Mount Fuji actually form a sense of unity.
They create Yin and Yang, forming balance in the system.
You should try to balance out your artistic abilities.

Ren: Do you know any small details about this painting?
Nasu: The boats in the picture can act as a scale to determine how big the wave is.
It's actually not all that huge.
Ren: Anything else?
Nasu: If you look to the upper corner, you can see the artist's signature.
Ren: Maybe I'll come back later...

@yes5
Ren: What's the process to make the paintings?
Nasu: After the painting is inked, the artist carves multiple wooden blocks.
The blocks ahve different parts of the design, and are inked with different colros.
Then the blocks are pressed into the paper, completing the design.
Would you like to try creating the painting?

Ren: How do they make these paintings?
Nasu: Well, making the woodblocks is a three stage process itself.
The artist first paints the design with ink, and then... uhh...
Well, I don't quite remember, to be honest.
Ren: (Maybe I can find something to jog his memory.)
