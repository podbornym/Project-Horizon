<b>Ren:</b> I managed to find this print.
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Ah, yes, now I remember! It was painted around 1680.
This print was one of the most famuous of its time.
If you'd like, you can try recreating some of it now.

<b>Ren:</b> What do you know about the artist?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Hishikawa Moronobu was born in 1618 and died in 1694, and is said to have set the standard for Ukiyo-e prints.
He started drawing designs for his father who was an embroider.
He later became an illustrator of storybooks using woodblocks.
Moroobu later went on to develop this skill into reproducing paintings for the populace.
Maybe you should try creating something as well?

@yes5
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> What's the process to make the prints?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> The paper would be glued to the blocks and rubbed with oil, peeling away upper layers to create a thin, translucent layer.
This layer acted as a guide for the block cutter, carving away non-black areas to form raised, inked areas.
This destroyed the original drawing in the process.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> But they used the blocks to create the final piece, right?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Correct! The artist would place the paper on the inked blocks and rubbed with a burnishing tool, creating the print you see today.
This print is hand-colored, something not commonly seen during the Ukiyo-e period.
Would you like to try creating the print?

#SetUkiyoMuse

The artist first draws the design with ink on handmade paper, and then... hmm...
Well, I don't quite remember, to be honest.
#SetPlayer
