<b>???:</b> Greetings, traveler. I am Nasu.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> What is this place?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> You are in Edo, otherwise known as Tokyo in your time.
This is the peak of the artistic cultural period known as Ukiyo-e.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Japan, huh? I should get some sushi while I'm here.
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> FOCUS ON YOUR ART, NOT YOUR STOMACH!
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> Sorry, haha!
What exactly is Ukiyo-e?
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, Ukiyo-e is made using wood carvings of prints.
After making the carving, ink is brushed across multiple wood blocks with various carvings.
The carvings form the different layers of the print, with different colored inks as well.
It's essentially multiple wooden stamps, but put to much more detail.
#SetPlayer
<b>Ren:</b> That sounds like it'd be fun to make.
#SetUkiyoMuse
<b>Nasu:</b> Well, you'll have plenty of time to try yourself.
Why don't you go have a look around and see what you can learn?
Each studio contains <b>6</b> different clues that you can find, but only after you talk to me first!
When you're finished, you can find me in any of the nearby studios.
Just click on me to ask me any questions you have. Have fun!
